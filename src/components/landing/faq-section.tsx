                answer:
                  "Anonymous feedback often gives people the freedom to share their honest thoughts without hesitation. This helps you receive more authentic, constructive, and unbiased input.",

                question: "How do you ensure the privacy of users sending feedback?",

                  "We never store identifiable information about the sender unless they voluntarily include it in their message. All communication is encrypted to keep data secure.",
              },
              {
                question: "What makes this platform different from other feedback tools?",

                  "Unlike traditional forms or surveys, our platform combines anonymous sharing, user-controlled message toggling, email verification for authenticity, and AI-powered suggestions to make feedback both safe and actionable.",
              },

                question: "Why is email verification required?",
                answer:
                  "Email verification prevents fake accounts, ensures that feedback links are tied to real users, and keeps the platform trustworthy.",
